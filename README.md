## python demo and tool

This is a project I would like to share with you about the tools I wrote for everyday life.

* demos: Includes prime examples for some common packages like gensim and lda. I would like to 
test these packages with a demo before using it in any real project.
* tools: Includes the common tools used in development, like crawler tools and image related tools.

Help yourselves!
